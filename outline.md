Aiming to get a flow for the paper here:

- Introduction
  - Motivation
  - Continuous Science Practices
  - Existing Tools / LitReview (Pandoc, Quarto, IdyllLang, LaTeX, RST...)
  - The gap
  - **Working with an upstream community.** (talk about the two hats)
- Authoring (MyST Markdown examples and libraries)
  - Myst is a OS project
  - Syntax overview (directives/roles) - this is very brief
  - AST Approach
  - Features & Goals
    - Citations and data-rich references
    - Deep dive links
    - Computation (via thebe)
    - Cross project references and embedding
    - Export to PDF
  - ... Make a big distinction. Believe in the future of this foundation. Interop, reuse, etc.
  - Curvenote is one of those products.
- Publishing (Curvenote-based examples and libraries)
  - Myst is a OS project
  - MyST in action, managing this via Curvenote infrastructure
  - Overview
    - CI on github, following JOSS
  - Checks
  - Archiving and computation (MECA // JATS // PDF)
  - Templates
- Case Studies
  - SciPy, AGU, MSA
- Conclusions

Curvenote developed the internals ... the critical components need to be in a open.
Don't pretend the tensions don't exist.
