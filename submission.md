  MyST (Markedly Structured Text, https://mystmd.org) is Markdown that is designed for technical communication and research publication. Sprinkling in all the typesetting power that you’d get from LaTeX but with the pleasure of lightweight content focussed writing that you get from Markdown, create interactive papers or documentation that link with data, have embedded computation and provide explorable notebooks to your readers. Get your work out to a templated PDF for traditional publication from exactly the same material, all from the command line or with continuous integration. In this talk, we’ll show how MyST works, how to get started and some examples of awesome MyST based publications.

## Scientific Publishing with MyST Markdown

MyST is a flavor of Markdown that adds in essential technical writing features through restructured text like roles and directives. This allows authors to create technical documentation and scientific publications complete with figures, captions, numbered equations, cross references and citations while writing in a lightweight, content focussed way with markdown. MyST is a powerful authoring environment that easily sits alongside code, packages and notebooks within version control.

MyST Markdown (https://mystmd.org/) is an open source project curated by the Executable Books team (https://executablebooks.org/) and is an evolution of JupyterBook. MyST Markdown is implemented in a modern toolchain that is permissive, allowing authors to work in LaTeX, markdown files and Jupyter Notebooks, it even enables conversion to and from Microsoft Word and new typesetting languages like Typst.

MyST enables web based publishing of computational articles, making it extremely relevant for the SciPy audience. Reproducible and explorable papers can be built from existing well known environment specifications and Jupyter Notebooks, or tutorials can be easily published from collections of Jupyter Notebooks alone.

In this talk we’ll introduce MyST Markdown and the toolchain that supports it. We’ll highlight the evolution this stack has made from JupyterBook and how the stack is being used for preprint publishing, by scientific societies and journals including the American Geophysical Union and Microscopy Society of America, and even powering the SciPy proceedings for 2024 (https://proceedings.scipy.org)!

We’ll also be hands-on during the talk, showing how easy it is to get started using the command line tools and we’ll publish an article to the web during the talk.
